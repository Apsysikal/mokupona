## General Information on Data Processing

### Scope of Processing of Personal Data

We process personal data of our users only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website as well as our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users regularly occurs only with the user's consent. Exceptions apply in cases where obtaining prior consent is not possible for practical reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by legal provisions.

### Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Data

When obtaining the consent of the data subject for processing operations involving personal data, Article 6(1)(a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.  
If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing required for pre-contractual measures.  
If the processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which our organization is subject, Article 6(1)(c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.  
If the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person, Article 6(1)(d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.  
If the processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by our organization or a third party and these interests are not overridden by the interests, rights, or freedoms of the data subject, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR serves as the legal basis.

### Data Deletion and Retention

Personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases. Storage may occur beyond this if provided for by European or national legislation in EU regulations, laws, or other provisions to which the controller is subject. Data will also be blocked or deleted when a retention period prescribed by the aforementioned norms expires unless further storage is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract.

In such cases, the IP addresses of users are deleted or anonymized, making it impossible to associate them with the accessing client.
